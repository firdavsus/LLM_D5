# Charts
## pre-train (loss, lr, grand norm)
![image](charts/training_curves_pretrain.png)
* train loss and graients are extremely stable due to large batch size 1M and appropriate shuffling. But why loss alsmost did not converge at the end is unknown, maybe I did something wrong :(

## fine-tune (loss, lr, grand norm)
![image](charts/training_curves_finetune-2.png)
* You can clearly see the train loss is dropped like from the stairs in the middle (this is due to 2 epoch start) but it is ok, typical fine tuning is run on 2 epoch. And gradiens going up at the end is common too in WSD scheduler as main learning happend at the end of training in decay phase (you can see it in train gradients too).

## some statistical charts (activation norm and weight distribution)
![image](charts/activation_plot_avg-3.png)
![image](charts/weight_distribution.png)
* weight distribution is mostly near 1.0 because it took maximum and minimum value, RMSNorm has a value of 1.0 by default and it is not changed a lot duting training so this is just visualization error.
